ENVIRONMENT INSTALLATION
1. create a new conda environment for preprocessors Python 3.7
	a. using conda cmd, run "pip install -r preprocessrequirements.txt"

2. create another conda environment for train/test Python 3.7
	b. using conda cmd, run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

TRAINING
1. Compile normal(non-fire) videos into train folder
2. Using the preprocess environment, run "python preprocess.py ./train 15" to preprocess videos by 15 fps
	a. a training.npy file must be present inside npys folder
3. Using the train/test environment, run "python train.py 50" to train the model with 50 epochs
	a. A model must be present in the Model folder

TESTING
I. PREPROCESSING
	1. Go to test folder
	2. For each individual video, create a folder containing only said video
	3. Using the preprocess environment, run "python preprocess.py ./test/vid_folder 15" to preprocess videos by 15 fps
		a. an npy file must be present inside npys folder containing the preprocessed video

II. TESTING
	1. Using the train/test environment, run "python test.py npys/vid_npy"
	2. The testing results(csv) are available in the results folder
